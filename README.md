The world is digitalized now, and we have to deal with a lot of emails on dialy basis.
The basic idea of this project is to detect whether the email is spam or not spam using the machine learning model, given the data set.
The data is in textual form, so we have to convert it into numerical vectors to make it easy for ML model to understand.
This conversion is done using TfidfVectorizer function in the ScikitLearn Library.
The accuracy of this model is 96%.
